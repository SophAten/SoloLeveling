        This first project is a video game that I created in my high school video
        game programming class. This project was created with a software named
        clickteamfusion 2.0. I had a couple months to do this project, but could only
        work on it during class time so the time was very limited. I worked
        really hard on this game, but it ended up having more than a few bugs. Solo Leveling is the
        name of a korean comic (called a manwha). This manwha inspired me to create this game for my
        class final project as I love the series. The game doesn't follow too closely to the main story
        of the series because I didn't have the skillset to make something so advanced at the time,
        but it is my goal to remake this project in the future. Clickteamfusion is a fairly easy software to use and there isn't much hard
        coding within it as it is more visual programming ratherr than using languages.

        To access the project you can click the link that says "Solo Leveling" that will take you to a google drive page where you can download the game.
        It might warn you that it is a dangerous file, but that is due to the nature of the Clickteamfusion software, I promise the
        game is completely safe to download. Make sure to press "keep" on the file when it downloads, then press "more info" and "run anyway".
        Thank you for trying my game.
